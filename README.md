## Overview
Welcome to the SDC-Saskpoly-JavaScript repository! This is where I document my journey of learning JavaScript during my Diploma in Software Development at Saskatchewan Polytechnic. After a brief pause in my 30daysofjavascript challenge, I dived back into the world of JavaScript, and I am excited to share my progress with you.

## Background

At Saskatchewan Polytechnic, our software development curriculum includes learning JavaScript, a versatile and powerful programming language widely used for web development. As a part of my coursework, I took on the challenge of creating a Weather App, pushing my boundaries to apply what I've learned.

## Getting Started Again

After a short pause in my 30daysofjavascript challenge, I decided to resume my learning journey with renewed enthusiasm. Here's how I got started again:

# Reflection:

I took some time to reflect on what I had learned so far and identified areas that needed reinforcement.

# Goal Setting:

I set clear goals for the remainder of my 30daysofjavascript challenge, outlining specific topics and projects I wanted to tackle.

# Resources:

I explored additional resources, including online tutorials, documentation, and community forums, to enhance my understanding of JavaScript concepts.

# Collaboration:

I engaged with my peers at Saskatchewan Polytechnic, discussing challenges and solutions, and participating in collaborative coding sessions.

# Weather App Assignment
# Project Overview
As part of my my Learning, I undertook the task of creating a Weather App. This project not only reinforced my understanding of JavaScript but also allowed me to apply my knowledge in a practical scenario.

# Features
# Real-time Weather Data:

The app fetches real-time weather data using a third-party API.

# Responsive Design:

The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

# User-Friendly Interface:

I focused on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface to enhance the overall user experience.

# How to Run!
Open the project in your preferred code editor.

Launch the index.html file in a web browser.

Explore the Weather App and enjoy!

## Conclusion!
My journey of learning JavaScript at Saskatchewan Polytechnic has been both challenging and rewarding. The resumption of my 30daysofjavascript challenge and the completion of the Weather App project mark significant milestones in my learning process. I hope this repository inspires and serves as a valuable resource for fellow learners and developers.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or even collaborate on future projects. Happy coding!

Keep coding, keep learning ðŸŽ‰!
